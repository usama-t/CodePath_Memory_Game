## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   
   I used outside resources in this projects. The W3Schools website helped me a lot.
   

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
   The most challenging task was to create a "gif" for the video walkthrough. I overcome this challenge by watching videos on YouTube.
   

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
    The most important question that I have after completing my submission is that is it necessary for me to learn JavaScript? 
    I found it very difficult as compared to CSS and HTML. Another important thing to ask is can I perform web development tasks offline? As for the Glitch project, I have to connect my PC to the Internet all the time.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   Right now, I am submitting my prework with the most basic requirements. I will also make sure that I work all the optionals to make the project more interesting. If I am able to implement the advance options 
   in the project, I will definitely update it on GitHub.
